# Automated-Receipt-Processing-System---Amazon-Textract
Built a serverless pipeline that ingests receipt images/PDFs to S3, extracts structured data via Amazon Textract, stores records in DynamoDB, and sends email alerts with Amazon SES. AWS Lambda orchestrates real-time processing for scalable, low-ops record-keeping and audit readiness.
