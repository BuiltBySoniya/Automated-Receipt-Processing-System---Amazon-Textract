# üöÄ Automated Receipt Processing System ‚Äì Amazon Textract

Serverless Receipt & Invoice Data Extraction Pipeline

## Short Description

Developed a serverless pipeline that automates receipt and invoice processing using Amazon‚ÄØTextract, AWS‚ÄØLambda, and Amazon‚ÄØS3. Upon file upload, the system extracts key fields (vendor, amount, date), loads structured data into a datastore, and triggers downstream workflows for archival and analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services Used:

Amazon Textract,
AWS Lambda,
Amazon S3,
Amazon DynamoDB (or alternative datastore),
AWS IAM,

## üß∞ Technical Tools:

Python (or Node.js) Lambda functions,
Boto3 (or AWS SDK) for AWS integrations,
AWS CLI / AWS SAM for deployment,
CSV/JSON data handling libraries,

## üß† Skills Demonstrated:

Serverless document-processing workflow,
Machine-learning based text extraction,
Automated ETL of unstructured data into structured formats,
Cloud-native storage, indexing and archival mechanisms,

## üìã Steps Performed

### Create S3 Buckets & Configure Upload Trigger:

Created an input S3 bucket for receipt/image uploads and an output bucket for processed results.
Configured an S3 event notification to trigger a Lambda function upon new file upload.

### IAM Role & Permissions Setup:

Defined an IAM role for Lambda with permissions to read from S3, invoke Textract, write to DynamoDB, and log to CloudWatch.
Ensured least-privilege access for document processing.

### Develop Lambda Function for Extraction & Processing:

Built a Lambda handler that receives S3 upload events, invokes Textract‚Äôs expense/receipt APIs, extracts summary fields (vendor, date, total) and line-items, and writes cleaned data to the datastore (e.g., DynamoDB).
Also moved processed files to archival/pending folders as part of post-processing.

### Load & Store Processed Data:

Saved extracted metadata into a DynamoDB table with a defined schema.
Stored raw Textract output (JSON) and original receipt files under versioned folders in S3 for auditability.

### Monitor, Archive & Validate Workflow:

Set up CloudWatch logs and metrics to monitor Lambda executions, Textract latency and error rates.
Configured S3 lifecycle policies to transition archival data to lower-cost tiers after defined retention periods.
Tested with sample receipt images, verified correct extraction of values, and validated end-to-end workflow.

## ‚úÖ Final Result:

Automated Receipt / Invoice Processing Pipeline

## üíº Business Implication:

This solution streamlines and automates receipt/invoice data entry and management, reducing manual labour, eliminating data-entry errors and accelerating finance operations. By leveraging serverless components and Amazon Textract‚Äôs ML-based extraction, organizations convert unstructured documents into structured business-ready data with zero infrastructure burden and high scalability.
